	abstract = {We present {TrackMate}, an open source Fiji plugin for the automated, semi-automated, and manual tracking of single-particles. It offers a versatile and modular solution that works out of the box for end users, through a simple and intuitive user interface. It is also easily scriptable and adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time, 3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants. {TrackMate} provides several visualization and analysis tools that aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of {TrackMate} is further enhanced through its ability to be readily customized to meet specific tracking problems. {TrackMate} is an extensible platform where developers can easily write their own detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis algorithms within the {TrackMate} environment. This evolving framework provides researchers with the opportunity to quickly develop and optimize new algorithms based on existing {TrackMate} modules without the need of having to write de novo user interfaces, including visualization, analysis and exporting tools. The current capabilities of {TrackMate} are presented in the context of three different biological problems. First, we perform Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess how light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early development. Our {TrackMate}-based lineage analysis indicates the lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we investigate the recruitment of {NEMO} ({NF}-κB essential modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the cytokine {IL}-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts in the shape of {TrackMate} characterized movements that confuse motility analysis. Finally, we validate the use of {TrackMate} for quantitative lifetime analysis of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in plant cells.},

	abstract = {Cell migration is a key biological process with a role in both physiological and pathological conditions. Locomotion of cells during embryonic development is essential for their correct positioning in the organism; immune cells have to migrate and circulate in response to injury. Failure of cells to migrate or an inappropriate acquisition of migratory capacities can result in severe defects such as altered pigmentation, skull and limb abnormalities during development, and defective wound repair, immunosuppression or tumor dissemination. The ability to accurately analyze and quantify cell migration is important for our understanding of development, homeostasis and disease. In vitro cell tracking experiments, using primary or established cell cultures, are often used to study migration as cells can quickly and easily be genetically or chemically manipulated. Images of the cells are acquired at regular time intervals over several hours using microscopes equipped with {CCD} camera. The locations (x,y,t) of each cell on the recorded sequence of frames then need to be tracked. Manual computer-assisted tracking is the traditional method for analyzing the migratory behavior of cells. However, this processing is extremely tedious and time-consuming. Most existing tracking algorithms require experience in programming languages that are unfamiliar to most biologists. We therefore developed an automated cell tracking program, written in Java, which uses a mean-shift algorithm and {ImageJ} as a library. {iTrack}4U is a user-friendly software. Compared to manual tracking, it saves considerable amount of time to generate and analyze the variables characterizing cell migration, since they are automatically computed with {iTrack}4U. Another major interest of {iTrack}4U is the standardization and the lack of inter-experimenter differences. Finally, {iTrack}4U is adapted for phase contrast and fluorescent cells.},

The tracking process requires no a priori mathematical modeling of the motion, it is self-initializing, it discriminates spurious detections, and it can handle temporary occlusion as well as particle appearance and disappearance from the image region. The efficiency of the algorithm is validated on synthetic video data where it is compared to existing methods and its accuracy and precision are assessed for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. The algorithm is well suited for video imaging in cell biology relying on low-intensity fluorescence microscopy. Its applicability is demonstrated in three case studies involving transport of low-density lipoproteins in endosomes, motion of fluorescently labeled Adenovirus-2 particles along microtubules, and tracking of quantum dots on the plasma membrane of live cells. The present automated tracking process enables the quantification of dispersive processes in cell biology using techniques such as moment scaling spectra.},

Therefore, the mechanisms governing cellular locomotion have been under intense scrutiny over the last 50 years. One of the main tools of this scrutiny is live-cell quantitative imaging, where researchers image cells over time to study their migration and quantitatively analyze their dynamics by tracking them using the recorded images. Despite the availability of computational tools, manual tracking remains widely used among researchers due to the difficulty setting up robust automated cell tracking and large-scale analysis. Here we provide a detailed analysis pipeline illustrating how the deep learning network {StarDist} can be combined with the popular tracking software {TrackMate} to perform 2D automated cell tracking and provide fully quantitative readouts. Our proposed protocol is compatible with both fluorescent and widefield images. It only requires freely available and open-source software ({ZeroCostDL}4Mic and Fiji), and does not require any coding knowledge from the users, making it a versatile and powerful tool for the field. We demonstrate this pipeline's usability by automatically tracking cancer cells and T cells using fluorescent and brightfield images. Importantly, we provide, as supplementary information, a detailed step-by-step protocol to allow researchers to implement it with their images.},

To enhance detection of phase transitions, we generated a new reporter whose oscillations are directly coupled to {DNA} replication and combined it with the {FUCCI} {APC}/C reporter to create “{PIP}-{FUCCI}”. The {PIP} degron fusion protein precisely marks the G1/S and S/G2 transitions; shows a rapid decrease in signal in response to large doses of {DNA} damage only during G1; and distinguishes cell type-specific and {DNA} damage source-dependent arrest phenotypes.

	abstract = {Fluorescence-based imaging regimes require exposure of living samples under study to high intensities of focused incident illumination. An often underestimated, overlooked, or simply ignored fact in the design of any experimental imaging protocol is that exposure of the specimen to these excitation light sources must itself always be considered a potential source of phototoxicity. This can be problematic, not just in terms of cell viability, but much more worrisome in its more subtle manifestation where phototoxicity causes anomalous behaviors that risk to be interpreted as significant, whereas they are mere artifacts. This is especially true in the case of microbial pathogenesis, where host–pathogen interactions can prove especially fragile to light exposure in a manner that can obscure the very processes we are trying to observe. For these reasons, it is important to be able to bring the parameter of phototoxicity into the equation that brings us to choose one fluorescent imaging modality, or setup, over another. Further, we need to be able to assess the risk that phototoxicity may occur during any specific imaging experiment. To achieve this, we describe here a methodological approach that allows meaningful measurement, and therefore relative comparison of phototoxicity, in most any variety of different imaging microscopes. In short, we propose a quantitative approach that uses microorganisms themselves to reveal the range over which any given fluorescent imaging microscope will yield valid results, providing a metrology of phototoxic damage, distinct from photobleaching, where a clear threshold for phototoxicity is identified. Our method is widely applicable and we show that it can be adapted to other paradigms, including mammalian cell models.},

	abstract = {Cell migration is essential to many life processes, including immune response, tissue repair, and cancer progression. A reliable quantitative characterization of the cell migration can therefore aid in the high throughput screening of drug efficacy in wound healing and cancer treatments. In this work, we report what we believe is the first use of {SiR}-Hoechst for extended live tracking and automated analysis of cell migration and wound healing. We showed through rigorous statistical comparisons that this far-red label does not affect migratory behavior. We observed excellent automated tracking of random cell migration, in which the motility parameters (speed, displacement, path length, directionality ratio, persistence time, and direction autocorrelation) obtained closely match those obtained from manual tracking. We also present an analysis framework to characterize the healing of a scratch wound from the perspective of single cells. The use of {SiR}-Hoechst is advantageous for the crowded environments in wound healing assays because as long as cell nuclei do not overlap, continuous tracking can be maintained even if there is cell-cell contact. In this paper, we report wound recovery based on the number of cells migrating into the wound over time, normalized by the initial cell count prior to the infliction of the wound. This normalized cell count approach is impervious to operator bias during the arbitration of wound edges and is also robust against variability that arises due to differences in the cell density of different samples. Additional wound healing characteristics were also defined based on the evolution of cell speed and directionality during healing. Not unexpected, the wound healing cells exhibited much higher tendency to maintain the same migratory direction in comparison to the randomly migrating cells. The use of {SiR}-Hoechst thus greatly simplified the automation of single cell and whole population analysis with high spatial and temporal resolution over extended periods of time.},

However, tracking cells for long periods remains a technical challenge, especially for multi-day, large-scale movies with rapid cell migration, high cell density, and drug treatments that alter cell morphology/behavior. Here, we present {EllipTrack}, a global-local cell-tracking pipeline optimized for tracking such movies. {EllipTrack} first implements a global track-linking algorithm to construct tracks that maximize the probability of cell lineages. Tracking mistakes are then corrected with a local track-correction module in which tracks generated by the global algorithm are systematically examined and amended if a more probable alternative can be found. Through benchmarking, we show that {EllipTrack} outperforms state-of-the-art cell trackers and generates nearly error-free cell lineages for multiple large-scale movies. In addition, {EllipTrack} can adapt to time- and cell-density-dependent changes in cell migration speeds and requires minimal training datasets. {EllipTrack} is available at https://github.com/tianchengzhe/{EllipTrack}.},

With this application in mind, we propose a global track linking algorithm, which links cell outlines generated by a segmentation algorithm into tracks. The algorithm adds tracks to the image sequence one at a time, in a way which uses information from the complete image sequence in every linking decision. This is achieved by finding the tracks which give the largest possible increases to a probabilistically motivated scoring function, using the Viterbi algorithm. We also present a novel way to alter previously created tracks when new tracks are created, thus mitigating the effects of error propagation. The algorithm can handle mitosis, apoptosis, and migration in and out of the imaged area, and can also deal with false positives, missed detections, and clusters of jointly segmented cells. The algorithm performance is demonstrated on two challenging datasets acquired using bright-field microscopy, but in principle, the algorithm can be used with any cell type and any imaging technique, presuming there is a suitable segmentation algorithm.},

This paper presents a method for segmentation of clustered partially overlapping objects with a shape that can be approximated using an ellipse. The method utilizes silhouette images, which means that it requires only that the foreground (objects) and background can be distinguished from each other. The method starts with seedpoint extraction using bounded erosion and fast radial symmetry transform. Extracted seedpoints are then utilized to associate edge points to objects in order to create contour evidence. Finally, contours of the objects are estimated by fitting ellipses to the contour evidence. The experiments on one synthetic and two different real data sets showed that the proposed method outperforms two current state-of-art approaches in overlapping objects segmentation.},

Despite substantial progress, there is a need to improve accuracy, speed, level of automation, and adaptability to new applications. This paper presents a robust and accurate novel method for segmenting cell nuclei using a combination of ideas. The image foreground is extracted automatically using a graph-cuts-based binarization. Next, nuclear seed points are detected by a novel method combining multiscale Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtering constrained by distance-map-based adaptive scale selection. These points are used to perform an initial segmentation that is refined using a second graph-cuts-based algorithm incorporating the method of alpha expansions and graph coloring to reduce computational complexity. Nuclear segmentation results were manually validated over 25 representative images (15 in vitro images and 10 in vivo images, containing more than 7400 nuclei) drawn from diverse cancer histopathology studies, and four types of segmentation errors were investigated. The overall accuracy of the proposed segmentation algorithm exceeded 86\%. The accuracy was found to exceed 94\% when only over- and undersegmentation errors were considered. The confounding image characteristics that led to most detection/segmentation errors were high cell density, high degree of clustering, poor image contrast and noisy background, damaged/irregular nuclei, and poor edge information. We present an efficient semiautomated approach to editing automated segmentation results that requires two mouse clicks per operation.},

This is challenging, as {CellProfiler} produces only tabular data for object tracking, and the graphical tools in Icy and Fiji are not optimal for manual review of these events. Here we describe Traxtile, a program that allows interactive graphical review and revision of object tracking assignments. Traxtile imports initial assignments and automatically identifies events needing review (i.e., apparent creation of new objects, splits, merges, and losses). For each such event, the object track is displayed on a montage of images centered on the event and spanning the preceding and subsequent frames. Links between cells in successive frames can be reviewed and edited, yielding validated tracks for the image series. Reports summarize events from the validated tracks. Traxtile is implemented in Python version 2.7 using standard distribution libraries (available at www.python.org) and is freely available at https://github.com/braunb/traxtile-public.},

The complexity and inherent randomness of the problem lead us to propose a unified probabilistic framework for tracking biological particles in microscope images. The framework includes realistic models of particle motion and existence and of fluorescence image features. For the track extraction process per se, the very cluttered conditions motivate the adoption of a multiframe approach that enforces tracking decision robustness to poor imaging conditions and to random target movements. We tackle the large-scale nature of the problem by adapting the multiple hypothesis tracking algorithm to the proposed framework, resulting in a method with a favorable tradeoff between the model complexity and the computational cost of the tracking procedure. When compared to the state-of-the-art tracking techniques for bioimaging, the proposed algorithm is shown to be the only method providing high-quality results despite the critically poor imaging conditions and the dense target presence. We thus demonstrate the benefits of advanced Bayesian tracking techniques for the accurate computational modeling of dynamical biological processes, which is promising for further developments in this domain.},

	abstract = {The fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of γ-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure.},

To define the mechanisms responsible for completing cellular functions, we used methods that can yield both temporal and spatial information on multiple physiological parameters and chemical components in the same cell. We demonstrated that the combined use of selected fluorescent probes, fluorescence microscopy, and imaging methods can yield information on at least five separate cellular parameters and components in the same living cell. Furthermore, the temporal and spatial dynamics of each of the parameters and/or components can be correlated with one or more of the others. Five parameters were investigated by spectrally isolating defined regions of the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectrum based on five distinct fluorescent probes. The parameters included nuclei (Hoechst 33342), mitochondria ({diIC}1-[5] ), endosomes (lissamine rhodamine B-dextran), actin (fluorescein), and the cell volume Cy7-dextran). Nonmotile, confluent Swiss 3T3 cells did not show any detectable polarity of cell shape, or distribution of nuclei, endosomes, or mitochondria. These cells also organized a large percentage of the actin into stress fibers. In contrast, cells migrating into an in vitro wound exhibited at least two stages of reorganization of organelles and cytoplasm. During the first 3 h after wounding, the cells along the edge of the wound assumed a polarized shape, carried the nuclei in the rear of the cells, excluded endosomes and mitochondria from the lamellipodia, and lost most of the highly organized stress fibers. The cell showed a dramatic change between 3 and 7 h after producing the wound. The cells became highly elongated and motile; both the endosomes and the mitochondria penetrated into the lamellipodia, while the nuclei remained in the rear and the actin remained in less organized structures. Defining the temporal and spatial dynamics and interplay of ions, contractile proteins, lipids, regulatory proteins, metabolites, and organelles should lead to an understanding of the molecular basis of cell migration, as well as other cellular functions.},

However, lack of diagnostic information at point-of-care limits effectiveness of debridement.Method:This observational case series investigated use of point-of-care fluorescence imaging to detect bacteria (loads {\textgreater}104CFU/g) and guide wound bed preparation. Lower extremity hard-to-heal wounds were imaged over a 12-week period for bacterial fluorescence and wound area.Results:A total of 11 wounds were included in the study. Bacterial fluorescence was present in 10 wounds and persisted, on average, for 3.7 weeks over the course of the study. The presence of red or cyan fluorescent signatures from bacteria correlated with an average increase in wound area of 6.5\% per week, indicating stalled or delayed wound healing. Fluorescence imaging information assisted in determining the location and extent of wound debridement, and the selection of dressings and/or antimicrobials. Elimination of bacterial fluorescence signature with targeted debridement and other treatments correlated with an average reduction in wound area of 27.7\% per week (p{\textless}0.05), indicative of a healing trajectory.Conclusion:These results demonstrate that use of fluorescence imaging as part of routine wound care enhances assessment and treatment selection, thus facilitating improved wound healing.},

However, accurately inferring information from {SPT} studies is challenging due to biases in both data analysis and experimental design. To address analysis bias, we introduce ‘Spot-On’, an intuitive web-interface. Spot-On implements a kinetic modeling framework that accounts for known biases, including molecules moving out-of-focus, and robustly infers diffusion constants and subpopulations from pooled single-molecule trajectories. To minimize inherent experimental biases, we implement and validate stroboscopic photo-activation {SPT} ({spaSPT}), which minimizes motion-blur bias and tracking errors. We validate Spot-On using experimentally realistic simulations and show that Spot-On outperforms other methods. We then apply Spot-On to {spaSPT} data from live mammalian cells spanning a wide range of nuclear dynamics and demonstrate that Spot-On consistently and robustly infers subpopulation fractions and diffusion constants.},

However, extracting that information is not a trivial task due to the stochastic nature of the particles' movement and the sampling noise. In this paper, we adopt a deep-learning method known as a convolutional neural network ({CNN}) to classify modes of diffusion from given trajectories. We compare this fully automated approach working with raw data to classical machine learning techniques that require data preprocessing and extraction of human-engineered features from the trajectories to feed classifiers like random forest or gradient boosting. All methods are tested using simulated trajectories for which the underlying physical model is known. From the results it follows that {CNN} is usually slightly better than the feature-based methods, but at the cost of much longer processing times. Moreover, there are still some borderline cases in which the classical methods perform better than {CNN}.},

At intermediate length scales, characteristic oscillations resolve the crossover between directed motion to orientational relaxation and allow us to discriminate active Brownian motion from other reorientation processes, e.g., run-and-tumble motion. A direct comparison to theoretical predictions reliably yields the rotational and translational diffusion coefficients of the particles, the mean and width of their speed distribution, and the temporal evolution of these parameters.},

	abstract = {Single Particle Tracking ({SPT}) is a powerful class of methods for studying the dynamics of biomolecules inside living cells. The techniques reveal the trajectories of individual particles, with a resolution well below the diffraction limit of light, and from them the parameters defining the motion model, such as diffusion coefficients and confinement lengths. Most existing algorithms assume these parameters are constant throughout an experiment. However, it has been demonstrated that they often vary with time as the tracked particles move through different regions in the cell or as conditions inside the cell change in response to stimuli. In this work, we propose an estimation algorithm to determine time-varying parameters of systems that discretely switch between different linear models of motion with Gaussian noise statistics, covering dynamics such as diffusion, directed motion, and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck dynamics. Our algorithm consists of three stages. In the first stage, we use a sliding window approach, combined with Expectation Maximization ({EM}) to determine maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters as a function of time. These results are only used to roughly estimate the number of model switches that occur in the data to guide the selection of algorithm parameters in the second stage. In the second stage, we use Change Detection ({CD}) techniques to identify where the models switch, taking advantage of the off-line nature of the analysis of {SPT} data to create non-causal algorithms with better precision than a purely causal approach. Finally, we apply {EM} to each set of data between the change points to determine final parameter estimates. We demonstrate our approach using experimental data generated in the lab under controlled conditions.},

	abstract = {Accurate detection and segmentation of cell nuclei in volumetric (3D) ﬂuorescence microscopy datasets is an important step in many biomedical research projects. Although many automated methods for these tasks exist, they often struggle for images with low signal-to-noise ratios and/or dense packing of nuclei. It was recently shown for 2D microscopy images that these issues can be alleviated by training a neural network to directly predict a suitable shape representation (star-convex polygon) for cell nuclei. In this paper, we adopt and extend this approach to 3D volumes by using star-convex polyhedra to represent cell nuclei and similar shapes. To that end, we overcome the challenges of 1) ﬁnding parameter-efﬁcient star-convex polyhedra representations that can faithfully describe cell nuclei shapes, 2) adapting to anisotropic voxel sizes often found in ﬂuorescence microscopy datasets, and 3) efﬁciently computing intersections between pairs of star-convex polyhedra (required for non-maximum suppression). Although our approach is quite general, since star-convex polyhedra include common shapes like bounding boxes and spheres as special cases, our focus is on accurate detection and segmentation of cell nuclei. Finally, we demonstrate on two challenging datasets that our approach ({STARDIST}-3D) leads to superior results when compared to classical and deep learning based methods.},

Classical experiments indicated that cells sense the mitogens or growth factors that control cell division within a limited window during the cell cycle. Min et al. reexamined this issue with high-throughput live-cell imaging and temporally controlled perturbations to more closely monitor dynamic signal processing. Human epithelial cells in culture integrated the mitogenic signals sensed throughout the cell cycle. One important factor was the control of translation rates, which influenced the amount of cyclin D, thus regulating proliferation. The results may also help to explain how cells maintain a uniform size.

Multicellular organisms use mitogens to regulate cell proliferation, but how fluctuating mitogenic signals are converted into proliferation-quiescence decisions is poorly understood. In this work, we combined live-cell imaging with temporally controlled perturbations to determine the time scale and mechanisms underlying this system in human cells. Contrary to the textbook model that cells sense mitogen availability only in the G1 cell cycle phase, we find that mitogenic signaling is temporally integrated throughout the entire mother cell cycle and that even a 1-hour lapse in mitogen signaling can influence cell proliferation more than 12 hours later. Protein translation rates serve as the integrator that proportionally converts mitogen history into corresponding levels of cyclin D in the G2 phase of the mother cell, which controls the proliferation-quiescence decision in daughter cells and thereby couples protein production with cell proliferation.
Human epithelial cells can monitor mitogen availability throughout the cell cycle to regulate cell division.

	abstract = {Ever since the establishment of cell theory in the early 19th century, which recognized the cell as the fundamental building unit of life, biologists have sought to explain the underlying principles. Momentous discoveries were made over the course of many decades of research [1], but the quest to attain full understanding of cellular mechanisms and how to manipulate them to improve health continues to the present day, with bigger budgets, more minds, and more sophisticated tools than ever before. One of the tools to which a great deal of the progress in cell biology can be attributed is light microscopy [2]. The field has come a long way since Antoni van Leeuwenhoeks first steps in the 1670s toward improving and exploiting microscopic imaging for studying life at the cellular level. Not only do biologists today have a plethora of different, complementary microscopic imaging techniques at their disposal that enable them to visualize phenomena even way below the classical diffraction limit of light, advanced microscope systems also allow them to easily acquire very large numbers of images within just a matter of hours. The abundance, heterogeneity, dimensionality, and complexity of the data generated in modern imaging experiments rule out manual image management, processing, and analysis. Consequently, computerized techniques for performing these tasks have become of key importance for further progress in cell biology [3][6]. A central problem in many studies, and often regarded as the cornerstone of image analysis, is image segmentation. Specifically, since cellular morphology is an important phenotypic feature that is indicative of the physiological state of a cell, and since the cell contour is often required for subsequent analysis of intracellular processes (zooming in to nanoscale), or of cell sociology (zooming out to millimeter scale), the problem of cell segmentation has received increasing attention in past years [7]. Here we reflect on how the field has evolved over the years and how past developments can be expected to extrapolate into the future.},
